FV3ser
======
FV3ser ('ef-vee-threezer') is a Python (using Gt4py with Dawn) version of the FV3 dynamical core (fv3gfs-fortran repo), with regression test data of computation units coming from serialized output from the fortran model generated with the Gridtools/serialbox repo.

------------
Getting started
------------
* To run the existing unit tests 
'make tests'
See 'Unit Testing' section below for unit test options
This will create a running container TestDataContainer-<version> which can be used to volume the test data from.
'make cleanup_container' will stop and remove this container

* To rebuild the backend Dawn/Gt4py environment before running tests
PULL=False make tests
OR
make rebuild_environment
make tests


------------
Developing stencils
------------
Make a code change in the 'fv3' directory, then run 'make tests'
OR
Option: develop stencils using data and code as volumes into a container: 

Extracting test data: 

* To extract test data from the container if you want to work with it outside the container
make pull_test_data
make extract_test_data
After you have extracted the test data:
'make dev'
The run the tests from /port_dev instead of /fv3

If you prefer using docker run directly:
docker run -v <Local fv3gfs checkout>:/port_dev -v <TEST DATA PATH>:/test_data   --name <your favorite name> -it us.gcr.io/vcm-ml/fv3ser
Then in the container :
pytest -v -s --data_path=/test_data/ /port_dev/fv3/test --which_modules=<Your stencil>

------------
Installation
------------

-- build the us.gcr.io/vcm-ml/fv3ser container with required dependencies for running the python code 
make build

To build from scratch (without docker pulling)
PULL=False make build

------------
Relevant repositories
------------
This package uses submodules that can be used to generate serialization data. If you would like to work with them (e.g. to make new serialization data etc.), after you check out the repository, you can run
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

------------
'Unit' testing stencils -- running regression tests of python FV3 functions and comparing to data serialized from the fortran model
------------
TEST_ARGS="add pytest command line args (see below)" make tests (or run_tests_container or run_tests_host_data)

Test options:
   --which_modules <modules to run tests for> : comma separated list of which modules to test (default 'all')
   
   --print_failures : if your test fails, it will only report the first datapoint. If you want all the nonmatching regression data to print out (so you can see if there are patterns, e.g. just incorrect for the first 'i' or whatever'), this will print out for every failing test all the non-matching data

   --failure_stride: whhen printing failures, print avery n failures only
   
   --data_path : path to where you have the 'Generator*.dat' and '*.json' serialization regression data. Defaults to current directory.
   
   --data_backend : which backend to use for data storage, default: numpy, other options: gtmc, gtx86, gtcuda, debug
   
   --exec_backend: which backend to use for stencil computation, default numpy, other options: gtmc, gtx86, gtcuda, debug, and dawn:gtmc

------------
Generating test data
------------
* This should be done hopefully infrequently in conjunction with a change to the serialization statements in fv3gfs-fortran
1. make changes to fv3gfs-fortran, PR and merge changes to master (or if just testing an idea, 'git submodule update --init --recursive' to work on the fortran code locally)
2. increment the FORTRAN_VERSION in the Makefile
3. 'make generate_test_data' -- this will
        * git submodule update if you have not already
	* compile the fortran model with serialization on
	* generate a run directory using fv3config in a container (also submoduled) and the 'serialize.yml' configuration specified in fv3/test
	* run the model on this configuration
	* copy the data to a new image and delete the rundirectory image (it is large and usually don't need it anymore)
4. if you want to commit this, open a PR, merge and run 'post_test_data'

------------
Dockerfiles
------------

There are 3 main Dockerfiles in the 'docker' folder
 1) Dockerfile.build_environment -- builds off of the serialbox environment from fv3gfs-fortran, installs Dawn and Gt4py
 2) Dockerfile -- uses the build environment and copies in the fv3 folder only. This is to make development easier so that when you change a file in fv3, 'make build' does not accidentally or otherwise trigger a 20 minute rebuild of all of those installations, but just updates the code in the fv3ser image. 
 3) Dockerfile.fortran_model_data -- builds the fv3gfs-fortran model with serialization on, sets up a run directory and generates test data. This is to be done infrequently and is orthogonal to the content in the other dockerfiles.
